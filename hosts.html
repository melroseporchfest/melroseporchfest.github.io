        <p><strong>We are full for 2018! Thanks to all of our hosts! But, if you are interested in hosting, read on, and maybe you can do it next year.</strong></p>
        <p>So, you've always wanted to host a concert? Now's your chance! Porchfest is easy and fun and, as the host, you determine just what you want to do.</p>
        <p><strong>Here are a few things to know:</strong></p>
        <p>"Porch" is a loose term. For the purposes of Porchfest: driveways, garages, and decks all count as "porches." Just so long as people in our community can easily access listening to music. In other words, if you have a deck, but the only way for people to get there is through your house and your mother in-law's room, this isn't a great fit. But if you don't have a porch, or have a small porch: improvise.</p>
        <p>Melrose Porchfest is from 2-6, but if you can only host from 2-3, that's fine! You determine when the music happens at your home.</p>
        <p>If you know musicians, and can fill the slots you want to host, go for it. Just let us know who is playing at your house and when.</p>
        <p>If you need musicians to play your porch, we can help you. Just be clear on our sign up form with the times you can host and any preferences you have.</p>
        <p>We will not put your house on our website and map unless we hear from you. So if a friend of yours is in a band has asked you to host and you've said yes to them, but haven't told us anything, we need to hear from you.</p>
        <p>Usually, a band or musician will play for a 1 or 2 hour slot. We don't recommend acts playing for longer than that, unless your act is Bruce Springsteen.</p>
        <p>You can decide if the musicians plug in and play electric or things stay more mellow with an unamplified, acoustic set. Your call.</p>
        <p>You do not pay the bands. They can put out a tip jar, and sell merchandise, but playing Porchfest is for fun, not for fame and fortune.</p>
        <p>It is a nice thing to have water available for the bands.</p>
        <p>You don't have to (and probably shouldn't) let people stopping by to listen into your house. But please let the musicians use the bathroom.</p>

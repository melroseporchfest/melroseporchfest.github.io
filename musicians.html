    <p>Singers! Drummers! Gee-tar players! Weâ€™re excited for you to help turn our little city into a celebration of music on September 29. So, thanks for your interest, and we hope this information page will give you everything you need to get going.</p>
    <p>Fill out this easy form and we will be in touch with a spot for you to play.</p>
    <p>You do not need to be a professional musician to play Porchfest. All skill levels are welcome.</p>
    <p>There is no payment for playing Porchfest. You may busk by putting out a case or tip jar at your show(s) and if you have merchandise, you may put it out for sale.</p>
    <p>What else are you wondering? Drop us a line.</p>

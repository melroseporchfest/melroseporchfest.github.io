        <h1>About Porchfest</h1>
        <p>Porchfest is a music festival that takes advantage of the "stages" all over a city or town. Musicians set up on the porch (or deck, driveway, or other place) and those passing by are treated to a concert. Pretty good, huh?</p>
        <p>Melrose Porchfest is September 29, from 2:00 pm - 6:00 pm. The rain date is September 30, from 2:00 pm - 6:00 pm.</p>
        <h2>Some common questions include...</h2>
        <h3>Do I need a ticket?</h3>
        <p>No, you silly goose. The shows are free. Some musicians will put out a tip jar and you can show them some love, if you feel so inclined.</p>
        <h3>Where will the music be?</h3>
        <p>Check out the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HKs4fm5kZcH2" target="_">map of music</a> for Melrose Porchfest 2018!</p>
        <h3>I have a band! How do I play?</h3>
        <p>Hey! Cool! Check out the <a href="/musicians.html">info page for musicians</a> and then <a href="mailto:melroseporchfest@gmail.com">get in touch</a>--we have a few spots left for 2018.</p>
        <h3>I have a porch (or a driveway)! How do I host?</h3>
        <p>You're the best! We're all full this year, but <a href="mailto:melroseporchfest@gmail.com">contact us</a> and we'll add you to the mailing list for next year. That way you'll be the first to know about hosting opportunities for 2019.</p>
        <h3>I want to help! What do you need?</h3>
        <p>A community event like Porchfest runs on volunteers. And you get to hear great music all day while helping your community enjoy a fun event! The basic roles for volunteers are to help people find their way around Porchfest and to contact the Porchfest organizing committee if something's not working at a porch (like a microphone isn't working or something). Pretty easy stuff, and lots of fun. If you'd like to volunteer, please contact us at melroseporchfest@gmail.com and thank you!!</p>
